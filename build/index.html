            <p>
                So apart from from DirectEd,i am a highschool graduate(Kagumo High School). <br>
                curently not working just waiting to join university in September.Why did i <br>
                decide to join DirectEd? Well there are many reasons why i made this decision <br>
                Here are some of the reasons: <br> 
              </p>
                <ul class="myList ">
                    <li>
                        ¬ªI hade a great passion for learning how to code from a younger age. <br>
                        I used to watch alot of Youtube videos on python proramming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ¬ªI want to pursue software Engeneering and i saw DirectEd as a <br>
                        a great stepping stone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ¬ªIt is a free and has the Access scholarship which has been of great <br>
                        benefit to me.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ¬ªAfter completing the bootcamp they offer Paid Internships.

            <h5 class="text-centre text-black mt-20 underline-offset-8">WHAT ARE MY INTERESTS</h5>
            <p>
                So apart from the coding stuff, I am a big fun of football.My Favourite <br>
                Team is the mighty Gunners(ARSENAL).I don't only watch but i am good    <br>
                footballer and thats what i do in my free time mostly to free my mind. <br>
                I love football beacause it has taught me three main virtues that i <br>
                use in my daily life.Discipline,teamwork and hardwork.So apart from <br>
                from football, i love to travel,explore and meet new people.
